#Project Apartment

This project was very exciting and I am really happy with the way it worked out.  
Though it gave me a hard time in between as I kept getting a white screen when I tried to deploy it on my 
Android device.
Took me a lot of time to figure it out, but finally I managed to understand that it was a problem with the 
TriggerAnimation script. So, I had to recreate the Globe Animation and then it worked. Though, I still don't
know why I had to do that.
However, it was a great learning process, trying to find out what the problem was.

Also, I have added a background music for some bonus points :)
