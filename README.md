# ProjectApartment
This is my second attempt in creating a VR scene using Unity 5.4.2. The project under Udacity Nanodegree required us to create a model 
apartment with props, lights, etc. This project was very exciting as I had to experiment with animation and baking lights in the scene.

Hope you all enjoy this app!

Your **feedback** will be valuable. :)

##Please Note
You will have to use GoogleVR SDK package for you to build and run this app.
To get it, go to  `https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/download` 
And click **Download the Repo Directly**

###Import
Once the download finishes, unzip the repo and find the **GoogleVRForUnity** package. 
Drag that into Unity and accept the import dialog.

###Drag and Drop
Drag the prefab **GVRViewerMain** into the scene.
You will also need to add a normal camera in the location you want to view from.
**Deactivate** the VR Camera system we made and click run. You will be able to use **Google VR**.
