# ProjectApartment
This is my second attempt in creating a VR scene using Unity 5.4.2. The project under Udacity Nanodegree required us to create a model 
apartment with props, lights, etc. This project was very exciting as I had to experiment with animation and baking lights in the scene.

Hope you all enjoy this app!

Your **feedback** will be valuable. :)

##Please Note
I have not included the GoogleVR SDK for Unity in my repo. You will have to pull that to your project to build and run this app.
